                        <p>I remember the first time we became classmates.
                            We didn't exactly hit it off right away, considering how shy I was back then.
                            It took me a while to get the courage to talk to you, but once I did, I knew we were going to be friends.
                            You were so friendly and welcoming, and I felt like I could be myself around you.

                        <p>This was the year we really started to get to know each other on a deeper, more personal level. You were always there for me‚Äîlistening to my problems, giving me advice, and just being someone I could genuinely rely on. 
                            I felt like I could trust you with anything, and that meant a lot to me.
                            It was also the year you started becoming friends with some of our more popular classmates. Naturally, I was grateful for that‚Äîbecause it meant I got all the juicy gossip straight from the source üòÇ.

                        <p>When we were in 9th grade, we started getting closer than ever. You were always talking about that someone‚ÄîI won't say his name, but you know exactly who I'm talking about ü§£. 
                            I remember how excited you were to tell me all about him‚Äîevery little interaction, every small thing he did that made you smile. 
                            I was genuinely happy for you, and I loved listening to your stories, especially since, as you know, I was way too shy back then to even glance at my own crush. 
                            It was funny, because you were always so supportive whenever I shared something too.

                        <p>The only clear memory I have of us in 10th grade was when we were both struggling with our studies ‚Äî dealing with the challenges of the pandemic and the laziness it brought along. 
                            I still remember how we used to share answers and ask others for help with our assignments, just trying to get by. 
                            It was a tough time, but we got through it together, and I truly believe that made our friendship even stronger. 
                            Those moments, as chaotic as they were, mean so much to me ‚Äî and I still cherish them to this day.
                        </p>
                        <p>P.S. I still remember the kilig moments you had with that someone HAHAHA</p>

                        <p>This was the moment we had to go to different schools‚ÄîI went to DVRMNHS while you went to ACT. 
                            Even so, we still kept in touch, sharing stories about our studies, the friends we made, and everything else happening in our lives. 
                            This was also the time when things between us got a bit chaotic, but we managed to work through it. 
                            Thankfully, we never had a 'friendship over' phase‚Äîthough it was a close call, hehe.

                            I was focused on my studies, and you were busy with your own things. 
                            But even though we didn't see each other as often, we still made time to catch up and share our experiences. 
                            I remember how we would talk about our classes, our professors, and everything else happening in our lives. 
                            It was nice to know that even though we were apart, we were still there for each other.
